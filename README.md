# 4DX Dashboard

## Presentation

Welcome to the **4DX Management Showcase**, a project built to manage WIGs (Wildly Important Goals), LEADs, and LAGs, serving as a practical example to highlight modern software development practices.

This repository is more than just a functional 4DX applicationâ€”it's a **comprehensive showcase of a modern TypeScript monorepo**. It highlights how to build scalable, maintainable, and cleanly architected applications, leveraging cutting-edge technologies like **tRPC** for seamless server-client communication and **Vite** for lightning-fast development and builds. The technologies used are React and Node (Express), with the authentication and db layers powered by **Firebase**, enabling robust database and authentication capabilities.

Whether you're here to explore **best practices**, learn how to structure a **monorepo**, or get inspired by the thoughtful integration of tools and technologies, this project is built with you in mind. It's a sample repository that demonstrates:

- Clean architecture principles (applied in backend).
- Effective IDE configurations for smoother development workflows.
- A carefully curated combination of modern tools and technologies.

Dive in to discover how the pieces come together to create a powerful and elegantly designed application, and use this as a guide for your next TypeScript project! ðŸš€

## Architecture

The **4DX Management Showcase** is designed with a clean and scalable architecture to highlight best practices in modern software development. The application is structured as a **TypeScript monorepo**, leveraging the power of **Turborepo** and **PNPM** for efficient package management and build processes. Below are the key architectural highlights:

### Monorepo Structure

The repository is divided into three main packages:

1. **Shared (i18n)**: A shared library used by both the frontend and backend to manage internationalization (i18n) effectively. This ensures consistent translations across the entire application.
2. **Web (Frontend)**: The frontend application, built with React and Vite, focused on delivering a seamless user experience.
3. **Server (Backend)**: The backend application, powered by tRPC, adhering to clean architecture principles.

The **Turborepo** setup optimizes the development process with caching and parallel builds, while **PNPM** ensures efficient dependency management, reducing duplication and build times.

---

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend is designed with a clear folder structure and component hierarchy, drawing inspiration from these two sources:

1. **[A Front-End Application Folder Structure that Makes Sense](https://fadamakis.com/a-front-end-application-folder-structure-that-makes-sense-ecc0b690968b)**  
   This source was instrumental in organizing the folder structure, ensuring modularity, scalability, and clarity for the codebase.

2. **[Container-Presentational Pattern](https://tsh.io/blog/container-presentational-pattern-react/)**  
   This pattern defines the separation between container components (handling state and logic) and presentational components (focused on UI), creating a maintainable and reusable component hierarchy.

Key frontend features include:

- **State Management**: Efficiently managed using React Context and hooks.
- **Routing**: Handled by React Router, allowing a clear navigation structure.
- **Vite Integration**: For fast builds, hot module replacement (HMR), and optimized production builds.

---

### Backend Architecture

The backend adheres to **clean architecture** principles, emphasizing separation of concerns and modularity. The architecture is structured into the following layers:

#### Layers

1. **Data Layer**:

   - **Controllers**: Handle HTTP requests and map them to use cases.
   - **DTOs**: Define the data transfer objects for request and response validation.
   - **Repositories**: Implement database interactions.

2. **Domain Layer**:

   - **Models**: Define core business entities.
   - **Use Cases**: Represent the business logic and core application workflows.
   - **Repository Interfaces**: Abstract the database layer, ensuring flexibility and testability.

3. **DI Layer**:
   - Dependency Injection is managed using **InversifyJS**, ensuring loosely coupled and easily testable components.

#### Request Flow

The backend request flow follows a straightforward and logical sequence:

1. **Router**: Routes incoming requests to the appropriate controller.
2. **Controller**: Processes the request, validates input, and invokes the corresponding use case.
3. **Use Case**: Contains the core business logic. Optionally interacts with:
   - **Interactor**: Handles complex workflows or intermediate processing.
4. **Repository**: Accesses the database layer through the repository interface.
5. **Database**: Stores and retrieves data efficiently.

#### Backend Test

The backend test suite achieves 100% coverage using Vitest, ensuring robust and reliable code.

### Key Technologies

- **tRPC**: Facilitates type-safe communication between the frontend and backend.
- **Firebase**: Serves as the database, providing real-time data and robust authentication.
- **InversifyJS**: Manages dependency injection for clean and decoupled backend modules.

---

### Why This Architecture?

This architecture was carefully designed to:

- **Showcase Best Practices**: Demonstrates clean architecture principles, modular design, and efficient state management.
- **Ensure Scalability**: Easily accommodates new features and growing codebases.
- **Enable Maintainability**: Promotes a clear separation of concerns, making the codebase easy to understand, test, and extend.
- **Highlight Modern Tooling**: Leverages cutting-edge technologies like tRPC, Vite, and Turborepo for a robust development experience.

This project is not just a working application but a blueprint for building modern, scalable TypeScript applications. It's designed to impress, inspire, and serve as a valuable resource for any developer looking to adopt clean architecture and cutting-edge tools in their own projects.

# Installation and Testing Guide

Follow the steps below to set up, run, and test the project.

---

## Installation

Given my interest in working with Firebase, the installation process includes some of its more tedious aspects. As a next step, I plan to create another database repository using SQLite for direct use.

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   Clone the repository to your local machine using Git.
2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Use `pnpm` to install all dependencies in the root of the monorepo:

   ```bash
   pnpm install
   ```

3. **Set Up your Firebase account**

   - Sign up in Firebase and activate authentication and Firestore modules to be able to login and store data.
   - Create the config files neccesary to connect in backend and frontend. You can used the committed templates. I set the extension `.example`to all the files you need to configure, which are:
     - .env (server)
     - .firebaserc (server)
     - firebase.json (server)
     - firebase.json (web)

4. **Set Up an Organization and User**  
   Use the provided [Bruno collections](https://www.usebruno.com/) to simplify the creation of entities.

   - Obtain a JWT from Firebase (or temporarily make the API publicâ€”but letâ€™s keep that secret, Iâ€™ll deny ever suggesting it!).
   - Create an organization (Organization/CreateOrganization).
   - Create a user for the organization (AUTH/CreateUser).

5. **Run the Project**  
   Start the development server with Turborepo:
   ```bash
   pnpm turbo run dev
   ```

---

## Running Tests

To run the integration tests, you need to set up Firebase emulators locally:

1. **Install Firebase Tools**  
   Install Firebase CLI globally:

   ```bash
   npm install -g firebase-tools
   ```

2. **Login to Firebase**  
   Log in to your Firebase account (only first time):

   ```bash
   firebase login
   ```

3. **Initialize Firebase in the Project**  
   Inside the project folder, initialize Firebase (only first time):

   ```bash
   firebase init
   ```

4. **Start Firebase Emulators**  
   Run the Firestore emulator to support integration tests:

   ```bash
   firebase emulators:start --only firestore
   ```

5. **Run Tests**  
   Execute the test suite using the following command:
   ```bash
   pnpm turbo run test
   ```

---

## Additional Commands

The project includes several commands to enhance the development workflow:

- **Build the Project**

  ```bash
  pnpm turbo run build
  ```

- **Lint and fix the Codebase**

  ```bash
  pnpm turbo run lint:fix
  ```

- **TypeScript Compliance**
